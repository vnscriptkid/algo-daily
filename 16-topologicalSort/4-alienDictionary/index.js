// Alien Dictionary

// There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the characters.
// Write a method to find the correct order of characters in the alien language.

// Input: Words: ["ywx", "wz", "xww", "xz", "zyy", "zwz"]
// Output: ywxz
// Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:

// 1. From "ywx" and "wz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'.
// 2. From "wz" and "xww", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'x'.
// 3. From "xww" and "xz", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'z'
// 4. From "xz" and "zyy", we can conclude that 'x' comes before 'z'
// 5. From "zyy" and "zwz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'

// From the above five points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "ywxz"
